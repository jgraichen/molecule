# Molecule

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgraichen/molecule.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgraichen/molecule)

React/SASS UI molecules to assemble higher level components.

It's an experiment with components extracted from some projects while keeping everything simple and flexible. Also with tests.

TODO: Most of all.

All components should work with different font sizes, families and line height. Additionally they should not be specified at all to allow using these molecules in web application you do not directly control e.g. in plugins.

# Try yourself

1. Clone repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bundle install`
3. Run `make`
4. Open `examples/index.html`

# Use it.

Don't. Otherwise use browserify with coffeeify and envify.
